Gitpod requires a domain (or sub-domain on a domain) that is resolvable by your name servers. As Gitpod launches services and workspaces on additional subdomains it also needs two wildcard domains.

For example:

```
your-domain.com
*.your-domain.com
*.ws.your-domain.com
```

or

```
gitpod.your-domain.com
*.gitpod.your-domain.com
*.ws.gitpod.your-domain.com
```
